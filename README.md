# fake-useragent

Up-to-date simple useragent faker with real world database.

## Features

- Data is pre-downloaded & post-processed from [Intoli LLC](https://github.com/intoli/user-agents/tree/main/src) and the data is part of the package itself
- The data consists of a wide range of browser agents and various browsers
- Retrieves user-agent strings (both of type: `desktop`, `tablet` and/or `mobile` UAs)
- Retrieve user-agent Python dictionary (aka object), with fields like `useragent`, `percent`, `type`, `device_brand`, `browser`, `browser_version`, `os`, `os_version` and `platform`
- Supports Python 3.x

### Installation

```sh
pip install fake-useragent
```

Or if you have multiple Python / pip versions installed, use `pip3`:

```sh
pip3 install fake-useragent
```

### Usage

Simple usage examples below, see also next chapters in this readme for more advanced usages:

```py
from fake_useragent import UserAgent
ua = UserAgent()

# Get a random browser user-agent string
print(ua.random)
# Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:132.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/132.0

# Or get user-agent string from a specific browser
print(ua.chrome)
# Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; Android 10; K) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/131.0.0.0 Safari/537.36
print(ua.google)
# Mozilla/5.0 (iPhone; CPU iPhone OS 18_1 like Mac OS X) AppleWebKit/605.1.15 (KHTML, like Gecko) GSA/343.0.695551749 Mobile/15E148 Safari/604.1
print(ua['Chrome'])
# Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/131.0.0.0 Safari/537.36
print(ua.firefox)
# Mozilla/5.0 (Android 14; Mobile; rv:133.0) Gecko/133.0 Firefox/133.0
print(ua.ff)
# Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:132.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/132.0
print(ua.safari)
# Mozilla/5.0 (iPhone; CPU iPhone OS 17_6_1 like Mac OS X) AppleWebKit/605.1.15 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/17.6 Mobile/15E148 Safari/604.1 Ddg/17.6
print(ua.opera)
# Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/128.0.0.0 Safari/537.36 OPR/114.0.0.0
print(ua.edge)
# Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/125.0.0.0 Safari/537.36 Edg/125.0.0.0
```

#### Additional usage

Additional features that fake-useragent now offers since v1.2.0.

If you want to specify your own browser list, you can do that via the `browsers` argument (default is: `["Google", "Chrome", "Firefox", "Edge", "Opera"," Safari", "Android", "Yandex Browser", "Samsung Internet", "Opera Mobile", "Mobile Safari", "Firefox Mobile", "Firefox iOS", "Chrome Mobile", "Chrome Mobile iOS", "Mobile Safari UI/WKWebView", "Edge Mobile", "DuckDuckGo Mobile", "MiuiBrowser", "Whale", "Twitter", "Facebook", "Amazon Silk"]`).  
This example will only return random user-agents from Edge and Chrome:

```py
from fake_useragent import UserAgent
ua = UserAgent(browsers=['Edge', 'Chrome'])
ua.random
```

_Note:_ Fakeuser-agent knowns about browsers: Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari, Opera, Android, Opera Mobile, Mobile Safari, Firefox Mobile, Firefox iOS, Chrome Mobile, Chrome Mobile iOS and more (see again full list above).  
_Note #2:_ Since fakeuser-agent v2.0.0 the browser names are case-sensitive!

---

If you want to specify your own operating systems, you can do that via the `os` argument (default is: `["Windows", "Linux", "Ubuntu", "Chrome OS", "Mac OS X", "Android", "iOS"]`).  
In this example you will only get Linux user-agents back:

```py
from fake_useragent import UserAgent
ua = UserAgent(os='Linux')
ua.random
```

_Note:_ Since fakeuser-agent v2.0.0 the OS names are case-sensitive!

---

You can also specify the type of platforms you want to use, you can do that via the `platforms` argument (default is `["desktop", "mobile", "tablet"]`.
This example will only return random user-agents from a mobile device:

```py
from fake_useragent import UserAgent
ua = UserAgent(platforms='desktop')
ua.random
```

---

If you want to return more recent user-agent strings, you can play with the `min_version` argument (default is: `0.0`, meaning all user agents will match).  
In this example you get only user agents that have a minimum version of 120.0:

```py
from fake_useragent import UserAgent
ua = UserAgent(min_version=120.0)
ua.random
```

---

For backwards compatibility, a minimum usage percentage can still be specified with the `min_percentage` argument. However, the current list of user agents does
not contain this statistic. Therefore all of the user-agents will match.

---

_Hint:_ Of-course you can **combine all those arguments** to you liking!

#### User-agent Python Dictionary

Since version 1.3.0 we now also offer you the following "get" properties which return the whole Python dictionary of the UA, instead of only the user-agent string:

> **Warning**
> Raw JSON objects (in a Python dictionaries) are returned "as is".
> Meaning, this data structure could change in the future!
>
> Be aware that these "get" properties below might not return the same key/value pairs in the future.
> Use `ua.random` or alike as mentioned above, if you want to use a stable interface.

```py
from fake_useragent import UserAgent
ua = UserAgent()

# Random user-agent dictionary (object)
ua.getRandom
# {'percent': 0.8, 'useragent': 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/116.0.0.0 Safari/537.36 Edg/116.0.1938.76', 'system': 'Edge 116.0 Win10', 'browser': 'edge', 'version': 116.0, 'os': 'win10'}

# More get properties:
ua.getFirefox
# {'percent': 0.3, 'useragent': 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; rv:109.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/118.0', 'system': 'Firefox 118.0 Win10', 'browser': 'firefox', 'version': 118.0, 'os': 'win10'}
ua.getChrome
ua.getSafari
ua.getEdge

# And a method with an argument.
# This is exactly the same as using: ua.getFirefox
ua.getBrowser('firefox')
```

### Notes

You can override the fallback string using the `fallback` parameter, in very rare cases something failed:

```py
from fake_useragent import UserAgent

ua = UserAgent(fallback='your favorite Browser')
# in case if something went wrong, one more time it is REALLY!!! rare case
ua.random == 'your favorite Browser'
```

If you will try to get unknown browser:

```py
from fake_useragent import UserAgent
ua = UserAgent()
print(ua.unknown)
#Error occurred during getting browser: randm, but was suppressed with fallback.
#Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/122.0.0.0 Safari/537.36 Edg/122.0.0.0
```

If you need to safe some attributes from overriding them in UserAgent by `__getattr__` method
use `safe_attrs` you can pass there attributes names.
At least this will prevent you from raising FakeUserAgentError when attribute not found.

For example, when using fake*useragent with `injections <https://github.com/tailhook/injections>`* you need to:

```py
from fake_useragent import UserAgent

ua = UserAgent(safe_attrs=('__injections__',))
```

Please, do not use if you don't understand why you need this.
This is magic for rarely extreme case.

### Experiencing issues?

Make sure that you using latest version!

```sh
pip install --upgrade fake-useragent
```

Or if that isn't working, try to install the latest package version like this (`2.0.1` is an example, check what the [latest version is on PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/fake-useragent/#history)):

```sh
pip install fake-useragent==2.0.1
```

Check version via the Python console:

```py
import fake_useragent

print(fake_useragent.__version__)
```

And you are always welcome to post [issues](https://github.com/fake-useragent/fake-useragent/issues).

Please do not forget to mention the version that you are using.

### For Developers

#### User-agent Data

The user-agent data we retrieve from [user-agents.net](https://user-agents.net). Data is stored in [JSONlines](https://jsonlines.org/) format. File is located in the: `src/fake_useragent/data` directory.

We are currently working on a new automation script (see issue [#333](https://github.com/fake-useragent/fake-useragent/issues/333)) to fetch user-agent scripts from user-agents.net and up date the user-agents once in a while.

The data JSON file is part of the Python package, see [pyproject.toml](pyproject.toml). Read more about [Data files support](https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/datafiles.html).

#### Python Virtual Environment

We encourage to use Python virtual environment before installing Pip packages, like so:

```sh
python -m virtualenv env
source env/bin/activate
```

#### Local Install

```sh
pip install -e .
```

#### Tests

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
tox
```

#### Linting

To fix imports using ruff:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
ruff check --select="I" --fix .
```

Fix black code formatting errors:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
black .
```

_Note:_ When ruff v1.0 releases, we most likely move fully towards `ruff` instead of `black`.
